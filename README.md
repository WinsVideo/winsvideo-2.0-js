# WinsVideo 2.0
Hello! Welcome to the WinsVideo 2.0 project, our goal is to rewrite the whole website of WinsVideo. This is because for 2 years the website has been running with the PHP programming language which makes the user experience slow, the code is extremely outdated and is vulnerable to vulnerabilities in the site for example XSS, CSRF, and others. So, after thinking for a while we decided to rewrite the whole WinsVideo website in node.js with no PHP code at all, which we already started developing the upload page. After we finish the whole website, we will keep the legacy layout but will soon be removed due to the old codebase which is not safe and very slow. 

# Development
Another goal for our WinsVideo Rewrite is that it will be 100% open-source, users will be able to see the code of the website. 

## Setting Up
For developers who wanted to compile the website / project here is what you need to do. 
- Clone our repository 
- Enter the project directory
- Do 'npm install'
- And then run 'npm start'
And that's it!

## Commits
We are accepting commit from developers who is helping us build a better WinsVideo, it will be reviewed by WinsDominoes the head developer of the project :)

## Information
Currently, we are developing the upload feature which is 90% done. You can check the projects at https://github.com/WinsVideo/winsvideo-node-rewrite/projects to see our projects / tasks that we are working on.
