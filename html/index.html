	<h1>Welcome!</h1>
	<span>hey there! Welcome to WinsVideo Beta, this is where all of our beta features are being tested. 

		<br>all of our projects will be open source, you can check the code right here: <a href="https://github.com/WinsVideo">https://github.com/WinsVideo</a>

		<br><br>What are we working on? Well we are currently working on a full rewrite of the WinsVideo website written in pure javascript / node.js which makes the user experience faster and easier.

		<br>Information about the upload feature:
		<br>The upload page will be about 200% faster, this is because we have made our video processor a lot faster because of node.js. Using ffmpeg every video that you upload to the site will be converted to mp4, so every user can watch the video without any compatibility issues. </span>
